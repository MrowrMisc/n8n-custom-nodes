# Limitations of the Declarative Pattern

While the declarative pattern is great for simple use cases, it has several limitations:

- ❌ No custom logic or transformation
- ❌ Cannot handle pagination or retries
- ❌ No support for binary data
- ❌ Limited error handling
- ❌ Cannot dynamically modify requests or responses
- ❌ Harder to debug when things go wrong
- ❌ Not suitable for complex authentication flows

If your node needs any of the above, consider using the programmatic or modular declarative pattern instead.
