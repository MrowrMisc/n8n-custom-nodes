# Build Custom n8n Nodes Like a Pro 🚀

Welcome to the **n8n Custom Nodes Guide** — your comprehensive resource for building, testing, and publishing custom nodes for [n8n](https://n8n.io), the extendable workflow automation tool.

Whether you're building a quick internal integration or a polished community node, this guide has you covered with real-world examples, API references, and reusable patterns.

## 🧭 What You'll Find Here

- **📚 Public Node API** — Learn how to use the `IExecuteFunctions` context, access parameters, and return data.
- **🧩 Node Patterns** — Choose from Declarative, Programmatic, or Modular Declarative patterns depending on your use case.
- **🔐 Credential Strategies** — Implement secure authentication using API keys, OAuth2, service accounts, and more.
- **🧪 Real-World Examples** — See how production-grade nodes like PowerBI, WebSocket, and Apify are built.
- **🎨 UI & UX** — Customize your node's appearance and behavior in the n8n editor.

## ⚡ Quick Start

Here's a minimal but valid n8n node to get you started:

```ts
import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription, IExecuteFunctions } from 'n8n-workflow'

export class HelloWorldNode implements INodeType {
  description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    displayName: 'Hello World',
    name: 'helloWorld',
    group: ['transform'],
    version: 1,
    description: 'Returns a simple greeting',
    defaults: {
      name: 'Hello World',
    },
    inputs: ['main'],
    outputs: ['main'],
    properties: [],
  }

  async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions) {
    return [ [{ json: { hello: 'world' } }] ]
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Choose Your Path

### 🆕 New to n8n Node Development?
Start with the [Public API Overview](public-api/index.md) to understand the core concepts, then explore the [Declarative Pattern](patterns/DeclarativePattern/overview.md) for the simplest approach.

### 🔧 Building Complex Logic?
Jump to the [Programmatic Pattern](patterns/ProgrammaticPattern/overview.md) for full control, or check out the [Modular Declarative Pattern](patterns/ModularDeclarativePattern/overview.md) for the best of both worlds.

### 🔐 Need Authentication?
Browse our [Credential Patterns](credential-patterns/APIKey.md) to implement secure API connections with OAuth2, service accounts, and more.

### 🧪 Want Real Examples?
Explore our [Real-World Examples](real-world/GlobalsNode.md) to see how production nodes handle complex scenarios like WebSockets, binary data, and external APIs.
