# üìù Code Examples TODO

This file tracks all the code examples we want to add to the documentation. Each example will be embedded inline in the appropriate doc pages to make them more practical and useful.

## üß© Patterns

### Declarative Pattern
- [x] **Minimal `displayOptions` usage**  
  Show how to conditionally show/hide fields based on another field's value.
  ```ts
  displayOptions: {
    show: {
      operation: ['get'],
    },
  }
  ```

- [x] **Using `default` and `required`**  
  Demonstrate how to enforce required fields and provide sensible defaults.

- [x] **`loadOptionsMethod` with static options**  
  Example of a method returning a static list of options for a dropdown.

- [x] **`execute` returning a simple JSON array**  
  A basic `execute` that returns hardcoded data for testing.

### Programmatic Pattern
- [x] **`execute()` with conditional logic**  
  Show branching logic based on input parameters.

- [x] **Using `this.helpers.request`**  
  Make an HTTP request using built-in helpers.

- [x] **Error handling with `NodeApiError`**  
  Wrap a try/catch and throw a formatted error.

### Modular Declarative Pattern
- [x] **`description.ts` modular export**  
  Split node description into a separate file for clarity.

- [x] **`methods.loadOptions` in a separate file**  
  Move load options logic into a `methods.ts` file.

- [x] **`execute` using helper functions**  
  Import and use utility functions to keep `execute` clean.

### Other Patterns
- [x] **Trigger node with polling**  
  Use `poll` to emit data on a schedule.

- [x] **Binary node that reads a file**  
  Return binary data from a file path or buffer.

- [x] **Pagination using `nextPage`**  
  Loop through paginated API responses.

## üîê Credential Patterns

- [x] **API Key in query string vs header**  
  Show both styles of injecting an API key.

- [x] **OAuth2 with scopes and token refresh**  
  Full OAuth2 config with `authUrl`, `accessTokenUrl`, and `scope`.

- [x] **Service Account with JWT**  
  Use a private key to generate a JWT for auth.

- [x] **Manual injection with `this.getCredentials()`**  
  Access credentials manually in `execute`.

- [x] **Credential testing with `test.request`**  
  Add a test request to validate credentials in the UI.

## üß™ Real World Examples

- [x] **WebSocket server node**  
  Start a WebSocket server and emit messages.

- [x] **Power BI node**  
  Authenticate and push data to a Power BI dataset.

- [x] **Apify actor runner**  
  Trigger an Apify actor and poll for results.

- [x] **QR Code generator**  
  Generate a QR code and return it as binary.

## üé® UI & UX

- [x] **`displayOptions` with `show` and `hide`**  
  Show how to toggle fields based on other fields.

- [ ] **`collection` with `additionalFields`**  
  Use a collection to group optional fields.

- [ ] **`loadOptionsDependsOn`**  
  Dynamically load options based on another field's value.

- [ ] **Codex metadata**  
  Add categories, subcategories, and resource links.

---

## üß† Advanced Topics

- [x] **Error handling patterns**  
  Different ways to handle and format errors.

- [x] **Binary data manipulation**  
  Working with files, images, and other binary data.

- [x] **Tool metadata for AI**  
  Adding metadata for AI integration.

- [x] **Custom validation**  
  Validate user input before execution.
