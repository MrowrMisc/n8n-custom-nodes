# Limitations of the Modular Declarative Pattern

While this pattern is powerful and scalable, it has a few trade-offs:

- ❌ More files and structure to manage
- ❌ Slightly more complex to onboard new contributors
- ❌ Requires understanding of `loadOptionsMethod`, `hooks`, and `routing`
- ❌ Can be overkill for small or single-operation nodes

Use this pattern when modularity and maintainability outweigh the added complexity.
