# Limitations of the Programmatic Pattern

While the programmatic pattern is powerful, it comes with trade-offs:

- ❌ More boilerplate and setup required
- ❌ Slightly steeper learning curve
- ❌ Requires more testing and debugging
- ❌ Harder to visually inspect behavior in the UI
- ❌ Can be overkill for simple use cases

Use this pattern when you need the power—but don’t default to it if a declarative node will do the job.
