# Codex Metadata

Codex metadata enhances the node's appearance and behavior in the n8n UI and documentation.

## Syntax

```ts
codex: {
  categories: ["Productivity"],
  subcategories: ["Utilities"],
  resources: [
    {
      name: "Documentation",
      url: "https://example.com/docs",
    },
  ],
}
```

## Use Cases
- Organize nodes in the UI
- Link to external docs or support
- Improve discoverability in the node picker

## Tips
- Use consistent categories and subcategories
- Include helpful resource links
- Keep metadata up to date
