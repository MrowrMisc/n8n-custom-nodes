# Modular Declarative Pattern

The modular declarative pattern combines the simplicity of declarative nodes with the scalability of modular architecture. Itâ€™s ideal for large declarative nodes that need to stay maintainable and organized.

---

## ðŸ§© What It Is

- A declarative node that splits its `properties` and `operations` into separate files.
- Each resource or operation is defined in its own module and imported into the main node.
- Still uses `routing.request` blocksâ€”no `execute()` method.

---

## âœ… When to Use

- Declarative node with many operations or resources
- You want to keep files small and focused
- Youâ€™re using code generation or shared logic (e.g. hooks, helpers)

## ðŸ§  Key Features

| Feature                  | Description                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `routing.request`        | Declarative HTTP request definition                   |
| Modular `*.operation.ts` | Each operation in its own file                        |
| Shared `hooks.ts`        | Inject shared logic into options or properties        |
| `runHooks()` pattern     | Dynamically modify or enhance declarative definitions |
| No `execute()`           | Still declarativeâ€”no imperative logic                 |

---

## ðŸ§ª Examples

- **Apify Node**: Uses `runHooks()` and codegen to modularize declarative operations.
- **Brevo Node**: Imports `attributeFields`, `emailOperations`, etc. from separate files.

---

## ðŸš« Limitations

- Still limited by what declarative routing can express
- Requires more tooling or conventions to manage modules
- Debugging can be harder if logic is injected dynamically

---

## ðŸ§¬ Summary

| Strengths                        | Limitations                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Clean separation of concerns     | Still limited to declarative logic   |
| Scales well with many operations | Requires more setup and tooling      |
| Great for codegen and reuse      | Harder to debug dynamic hooks        |
| Declarative + maintainable       | Not suitable for complex logic flows |

The modular declarative pattern is a powerful middle groundâ€”perfect for teams that want the clarity of declarative nodes with the structure of a real codebase.
